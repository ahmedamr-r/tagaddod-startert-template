## 🤖 Working with Claude Code

This is where the magic happens! Claude Code is your AI assistant that can help you build features, fix bugs, and explain code - all in plain English.

### Activating Claude Code

#### Method 1: From VS Code
1. **Open Command Palette**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac)

#### Method 2: From Terminal
1. **Open terminal in your project folder**
2. **Type**:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
3. **Press Enter**

### Understanding CLAUDE.md

The `CLAUDE.md` file in your project is **extremely important**. It contains specific instructions that help Claude Code understand:

- How to use the Tagaddod Design System
- Which components are available
- How to style elements properly
- Project structure and best practices

**🚨 Important**: Always keep this file in your project. It's like a manual that helps Claude Code give you better assistance.

### Your First Conversation with Claude Code

Let's try some example requests:

#### Example 1: Adding a Simple Button
```
You: "Add a new button to the homepage that says 'Learn More'"

Claude: [Will read the component documentation and add a properly styled button using Tagaddod components]
```

#### Example 2: Creating a Contact Form
```
You: "I want to add a contact form with fields for name, email, and message"

Claude: [Will create a form using Tagaddod components with proper styling and validation]
```

#### Example 3: Explaining Code
```
You: "Can you explain what the useRTL hook does?"

Claude: [Will read the code and explain how RTL/LTR language switching works]
```

#### Example 4: Building Complete Features
```
You: "Create a hero section with a background image, call-to-action button, and newsletter signup"

Claude: [Will build a complete hero section using Tagaddod design tokens and components]
```

#### Example 5: Modifying Existing Elements
```
You: "Make the Tagaddod logo in the header clickable and larger"

Claude: [Will modify the existing logo implementation with proper styling and functionality]
```

### Best Practices for Working with Claude Code

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "make it look better", say "add more spacing between the buttons"

2. **Ask for Explanations**: Don't hesitate to ask "can you explain what this code does?"

3. **Request Step-by-Step**: For complex features, ask Claude to break it down into steps

4. **Use Natural Language**: You don't need to know technical terms. Say "make the text bigger" instead of "increase font-size"

5. **Ask for Documentation**: Request Claude to explain how to use new components it creates
